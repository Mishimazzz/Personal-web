      <Aboutme>
        <p>
          <span className="tab"></span>Hello there! Thank you for visiting my website!
        </p>

        <p>
          <span className="tab"></span>I'm Yueyan Ying, a Computer Science undergraduate student at McGill University.
          I enjoy building things that are both useful and easy to use, whether it's a responsive website, a backend system,
          or a database setup. I've worked on full-stack projects that helped me grow comfortable with both front-end frameworks
          and backend logic. <b>Please visit my Projects!!!</b>
        </p>

        <h4>What I'm Good At</h4>
        <p>
          <span className="tab"></span>I have hands-on experience in web development, working with tools like HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React. On the backend, I've used Node.js, SQL, and Python to build data-driven
          features. I like writing clean, maintainable code and figuring out how to make systems work smoothly together.
        </p>

        <h4>Academic Interests</h4>
        <p>
          <span className="tab"></span>I'm interested in web development, data science, and software design.
          I like learning by doing, especially through projects or team collaboration.
          I'm always looking for ways to improve what I build.
        </p>

        <h4>Personal Passions</h4>
        <p>
          <span className="tab"></span>In my free time, I love exploring new places, and playing video games.
          Recently, I've become really into board gamesâ€”I only wish I had discovered them earlier!
          As for video games, <span style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}>Stardew Valley</span> is by far my all-time favorite. It's honestly hard to put into words how much I love this game.
          All I can say is: just play it. Seriously. You won't regret it!
        </p>
